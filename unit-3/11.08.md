# Pod Meeting 11.08

### Week Recap 

Lots happened over the past few weeks and our pod hasn't met in a few weeks. Here's what happened: 

* Unit 2 Final Project - there was no clear standard with feedback - Tanner's presentation notes were very different from what we received after the final demo (ie: make it shorter vs make it longer). Learned that unnecessary feature buiding reduces group efficiency and is awkward to remove later. 

* Hackathon - would have loved to have product mentor meetings earlier so that we had time to implement suggestions. Learned that group communication is so important when deadlines are tight. 

* Final Project - no one has written too much code as the mentor meetings keep causing groups to pivot.

### Goals

* Improve group communication.
* Set up clear group goals and ground rules (ie: no pushing up broken code to the master repo)
