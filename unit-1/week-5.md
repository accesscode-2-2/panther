Talking about which projects we want to work on today.

##Discussion Piece
Summary about discussion piece. Some of us agreed with the conclusions of the article, while others thought it was a simplistic categorization of people.
Most felt like they wouldn't categorize themselves as either optimist or pessimist.

##Other General Discussion
* Varindra makes amazing cupcakes, Christian makes amazing flan, Shena makes amazing homemade pasta and they will all bring food next week..
* Christian is getting married next week!
* Discussion of gender roles in the workplace and upcoming event on friday, who's going, who's not and what they think about the "women in tech" theme.
* We discussed some of the confusion that has been going on about code reviews. The whole Panther pod was cc'd on Shena, Varindra and Bereket's project
code review, and Christian's group and Elber's group did not get a code review on the last project at all.
* Christian spoke about a website he used with Cameron to code simultaneously on the same project. The site is called https://coderpad.io
