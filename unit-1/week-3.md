Week 3
Date: 08/02/15
Attendants: Christian, Xiulan, Shena, Elber, Varindra
Team leader: Xiulan
ToDo's
Shena want to make a pizza APP.

We all hope Mike would teach us new concepts during weekends instead of Tue
and Thurs. It doesn't make sense for us to learn new concepts on Thurs and
hand in homework on Friday. 

We all think the order of homework and new concepts should be corrected. New
concepts first, then homework. It would save us a lot of time and understand
what to do and what we are doing.
 
We need to speek up to let Mike know what exactly is going on.

Achievements from last week:
There was a problem with Christian's homework when linking to the detailed
view page. He tried to figure it out why by comparing the demo code in class. 

Xiulan taught Christian the UITableView coding part, then Christian was able
to teach Eric the same thing.

Goals for this week:
Speak up in class - take home good notes.  
We need to reach out more with our pod members, using each other as good
resource.
