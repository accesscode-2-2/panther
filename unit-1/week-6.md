##Looking Back At This Week
Q. How was Facebook?

* We enjoyed going to Facebook, overall. 

* Elber made a point that it seem the most important thing to do is to constantly be making
  things, enhancing our porfolios to show that even if we don't have a degree in CS we can still
  cut it. (Good Point)

* What is objective c++?

Q. How are your groups moving along?

*  Shena and Xiulan are hating their group, just kidding they're in the same group.

*  Elber and Mesfin are getting along well

*  Shena's computer broke and had to get a new one


##Achievements of the Week
*  Raided FB's snack room and learned from top notch devs at FB.

*  Learned how to project plan from Tanner. The project planning is super useful.
   Division of labor and sufficient planning is still difficult. 

*  Shena is becoming a great cook. 

##Goals for next Week
*  Finish our projects
