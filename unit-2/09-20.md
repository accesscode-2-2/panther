 # Pod Meeting 09-20

### Week Recap
* Talked about our last class and the subjects we learned this week.
* The pace has been quick of late and we tried to clarify some of the topics with each other, especially blocks, notifications, and APIs.
* We talked about the Android cohort Demo Day, the things we liked and the things we disliked, how we would have done them differently.

### Goals
* Start thinking about cool ideas for final project apps.
* Get lots of practice with APIs
