We talked about our Unit-2 final projects, there are many travel apps in our group! 
Xiulan is sick. :(
Elber is eating fig newtons for breakfast.
Christian and Varindra helped each other with the homework project.
We are all sad about loosing Eric and Kaisha and want to help each other to succeed! 

Weâ€™re nervous about the next assessment, we hope to have a few days to study once the final project has been submitted.
